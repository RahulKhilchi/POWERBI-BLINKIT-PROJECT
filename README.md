# üìä Sales Analytics Dashboard Project (Excel + Power BI)

## üîé Project Overview
This project demonstrates a full analytics workflow from **data cleaning and preprocessing in Excel** through to interactive visualization using **Power BI**. The aim is to convert raw sales data into meaningful business insights through clear metrics, charts, and dashboards.

---

## üéØ Objectives
- Clean and preprocess sales data in Excel (handling missing values, standardizing formats, etc.).  
- Define and track key sales performance metrics (KPIs).  
- Build a Power BI dashboard to visualize trends, patterns, and comparisons.  
- Enable stakeholders to explore sales data by time, region, product category, and more.

---

## üìà KPI Metrics Used
- Total Sales Revenue  
- Sales Growth Rate (period-over-period)  
- Average Order Value (AOV)  
- Number of Transactions  
- New vs Repeat Customer Rate  
- Profit Margin  
- Top Products by Revenue  
- Regional Performance (State / City)  
- Sales vs Target / Goal Achievement

## ‚öôÔ∏è Process

### Step 1: Data Cleaning & Preprocessing (Excel)
- Loaded raw data into Excel.  
- Checked for missing or inconsistent values; filled or removed records as appropriate.  
- Standardized date fields, product names/categories, region/state names.  
- Created derived columns (e.g., profit margin, order value per transaction) where needed.

### Step 2: KPI Calculations
- Used Excel formulas/aggregation (SUM, AVERAGE, COUNT, etc.) to compute metric summaries.  
- Prepared summary tables to feed into visualization tools.

### Step 3: Dashboard Building (Power BI)
- Imported cleaned/preprocessed data or summary tables into Power BI.  
- Created visuals including line charts, bar/column charts, maps for region performance, and KPI cards.  
- Added interactive filters & slicers for time periods, product categories, and regions.  
- Designed dashboard pages to aid trend analysis and comparison (e.g., monthly sales, channel performance).

## üìù Key Insights
- The dashboard reveals which **products** are driving most revenue and which are underperforming.  
- Regional comparisons show markets that perform well versus those needing attention.  
- Trends over time highlight sales growth or decline periods.  
- Customer behavior insights, e.g., proportion of new vs repeat buyers, average order values.  
- Performance against targets helps understand how close sales are to expectations.
